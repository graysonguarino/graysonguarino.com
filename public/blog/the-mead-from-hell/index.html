        <h2 id="what-if-i-handmade-christmas-gifts-this-year">What if I handmade Christmas gifts this year?</h2>
<p>The oft-discussed &ldquo;five love languages&rdquo; concept includes gift giving as a
language of love. In middle school I remember we had to rank our love languages
from most preferred to least preferred, and if I remember right, gift giving
came out last. To this day, I&rsquo;m not the biggeset fan of giving or receiving
gifts.</p>
<p>Maybe I am a scrooge, a meiser, or an ahedonic post-capitalist (depending who
you ask), but I view myself as preferring practicality over everything. I&rsquo;ve
got drawers filled with gifts that have never found a use, and even more drawers
filled with things I <em>thought</em> I&rsquo;d use eventually, and the idea of taking
anything out of those drawers and transferring them to a landfill where they
wont decompose until long after I do doesn&rsquo;t sit well with me. I&rsquo;m not trying
to lecture here; gift giving is a tradition that has permeated cultures for
thousands of years. I just feel like many of the gifts I&rsquo;ve given in the past
have not been as useful as gold, frankincense, or myrrh.</p>
<p>The best gift I&rsquo;ve ever received, bar none, is the water bottle that my sister
gave me all the way back in 2019. It has received more use than maybe any
object I&rsquo;ve ever owned other than my smartphone. It&rsquo;s saved the landfills
probably hundereds of pounds of plastic waste by now. It&rsquo;s become a part of
my personality.</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure the gift was something that wouldn&rsquo;t go to waste.</p>
<h2 id="why-mead">Why Mead?</h2>
<p>Mead is a weird choice for a gift, but it came after I realized the following
things:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have equipment to brew beer already</li>
<li>More people will like a sweet honey drink than beer</li>
<li>I can reuse the bottles</li>
<li>You likely didn&rsquo;t already receive mead for Christmas</li>
<li>How hard can it be?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="quite-hard-actually">Quite hard, actually</h2>
<p>Mead is one of the easiest forms of alcohol to create. So easy, in fact, that it
can happen on accident.</p>
<p>This is because mead at its roots is simply honey, water, and yeast. Mead was
likely discovered when honey was left in a barrel, the barrel got rained on,
and yeast from the environment joined the party. Some time later, one of our
great ancestors then drank  from this barrel and then decided it was time for
some Friday Night Football, even though he had no concept of Friday Night or
Football.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s possible to make mead in a barrel with entropy alone, then it shouldn&rsquo;t
be too hard to make it with all my fancy autosiphons and glass carboys and
no-rinse cleansers and sorbates and metabisulfites.</p>
<p>This mead made me come to the realization that, at least when it comes to booze
production, I am sub-caveman.</p>
<h2 id="the-recipe">The Recipe</h2>
<p>I decided that since I was starting this brew in November, peak apple season, I
could make a cyser instead of a straight mead.</p>
<dl>
<dt>cyser (n.)</dt>
<dd>a mead that also contains apples</dd>
</dl>
<p>I found [this recipe on YouTube from Man Made Mead](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/">https://www.youtube.com/</a>
watch?v=NF1dhaeysB0) on an apple-cinnamon cyser. The  cinnamon scored this
recipe bonus Christmas points.</p>
<h2 id="day-1---november-7-2023">Day 1 - November 7, 2023</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sanitize everything with one tablespoon of One Step Cleaner per gallon of warm water</li>
<li>Pour 2.5 gallons of apple juice into a 6-gallon carboy</li>
<li>Pour 2.5 gallons of distilled water into a 6-gallon carboy</li>
<li>Add 5 pounds of honey</li>
<li>Actually, add about 3 more pounds of honey</li>
</ul>
<p>I decided to add more honey to increase the ABV (alcohol by volume) to closer
something &gt;10%. The original recipe aimed for about 6-7%, but at the last
minute, I decided to make this a still mead instead of a sparking mead like the
recipe states. This is because I needed to backsweeten the mead, but if I wanted
to have the mead ferment in the bottle to become carbonated, I would have to
backsweeten with a non-fermentable sweetner like erythritol.</p>
<dl>
<dt>backsweeten (v.)</dt>
<dd>to add sugar back into a fermented beverage after the yeast have eaten all the
initial sugar during fermentation</dd>
</dl>
<p>If there was too much fermentable sugar in the bottle, with a yeast with such
high alcohol tolerance, I could very easily have too much fermentation happen
in a sealed glass bottle. If that happens, I would have created a pantry filled
with cinnamon-apple-flavored glass bombs. It felt too weird to add  artificial
sweetner to something that&rsquo;s filled with honey, so I decided against it.</p>
<dl>
<dt>foreshadowing (n.)</dt>
<dd>a literary device used to suggest an event that will happen later in the story</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Mix all the ingredients together with a big plastic rod with expandable wings
attached to a drill you told your dad you were borrowing to help your friend
Tyler assemble a bedframe</li>
<li>Siphon out a sample large enough to get a hydrometer reading, then write that down</li>
<li>Mix the yeast in warm water for 20 seconds as described in the yeast packet&rsquo;s instructions</li>
<li>Pour the yeast in</li>
<li>Wait, no, soak it for 20 minutes, not 20 seconds</li>
<li>Worry a little bit, Google a little bit, read that it&rsquo;s probably going to be fine, proceed</li>
<li>Place the (sanitized) stopper and airlock on the carboy</li>
<li>Set it in the back of your closet</li>
<li>Wait</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/blog/The-Mead-From-Hell/GoodnightSweetPrince.jpeg" alt="Goodnight, sweet prince"></p>
<p>The hydrometer reading tells the specific gravity of the mead in its current,
unfermented state (called &ldquo;must&rdquo;). Specific gravity  means&hellip;I don&rsquo;t know
actually. I think it&rsquo;s how thick the liquid is? (I&rsquo;m not sure I could tell you
what makes a liquid &ldquo;thick&rdquo;.) In our case, it tells us how much sugar is in the
must right now so that once its done fermenting, we can calculate how much of
the sugar has been fermented and turned into alcohol. That will tell us the ABV.</p>
<p>With an original gravity (OG, and yes, I will be finding reasons to say that
again) of 1.071, if the yeast eats all the sugar and turns it into alcohol
bringing the final gravity (FG) all the way back down to a 1.000, we can use the
following formula to calculate the ABV of the final product:</p>
<p><code>ABV = (OG - FG) * 131.25</code></p>
<p>In our case:</p>
<p><code>ABV = (1.071 - 1.000) * 131.25 = 9.32%</code></p>
<p>I was aiming for a higher ABV, but I used literally all the honey I had in my home.</p>
<h2 id="day-11---november-18-2023">Day 11 - November 18, 2023</h2>
<p>The airlock on the carboy has all but stopped bubbling, bubbling only once every
several minutes, so I decided it was time to start prepping the apples. This
is where my lovely girlfriend Emily enters this story. We went to Sam&rsquo;s Club to
purchase 18lbs of apples and absolutely nothing else.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/The-Mead-From-Hell/ApplesLaidOut.jpeg" alt="The apples in question">
(The varieties, for those wondering, were Gala, Cosmic Crunch, Honeycrisp, and
Fuji.)</p>
<p>After all the edible wax was boiled off of the apples, I sliced all the apples
with the apple slicer Emily was so kind to bring from her home, and as I was
slicing them, remembered I had purchased pectic enzyme to put on the apples
to help extract more juice. I realized I had no idea <em>when</em> one should put the
pectic enzyme on the apples, so I sent Emily down the rabbit hole for me.</p>
<p>Emily, who has never homebrewed in her life and I don&rsquo;t even think has tried
mead before, scowered meadmaking forums and /r/mead and gave me all the
information she could find. She soon after started discovering a bunch of
techniques and recipes I had never heard of. It really warmed my heart to
see her take an interest in this. Ever since, she&rsquo;s continued coming up
with new flavors we can try to brew. I hope the two of us will get to
make all of them.</p>
<p>Later that same night, we cooked potato soup for our friend Lauren. Lauren,
who is a recipient of the mead I have secretly been fermenting under my
summer wardrobe, could not know why I had so much apple paraphanelia in
my kitchen.</p>
<p>I lied and told her I wanted to try making apple juice.</p>
<p>She said that sounds like the kind of activity I&rsquo;d be up to.</p>
<h2 id="day-12---november-19-2023">Day 12 - November 19, 2023</h2>
<p>I siphoned all the mead into a plastic bucket fermenter and mixed in
potassium metabisulfite (to prevent oxidation of the mead which can
produce off flavors) and potassium sorbate (to stop the yeast from
reproducing and eating the apple juice.) I then immediately dumped
all the apples into the bucket, sealed it up, and went about my day.</p>
<p>(Actually, I only was able to add about 13lbs of apples because the
bucket was overflowing.)</p>
<p>So far, things are going well.</p>
<h2 id="day-13---november-20-2023">Day 13 - November 20, 2023</h2>
<p>Things are no longer going well.</p>
<p>The airlock, which should be completely inactive since I stabalized
the mead yesterday, is going bananas. Somehow the mead began to
ferment again.</p>
<p>After doing some searching, I found out that I had <em>not</em> properly
stabalized the mead. It turns out you have to wait 24 hours after
adding the stabalizing agents before they take effect. The yeast
repopulated quickly and were eating all my precious apple juice.</p>
<p>This left me with one choice: kill it with fire.</p>
<p>My concern was no longer with neutering the yeast, they had to
die. Now. The longer they lived, the less apple sugar would
make it into the final product.</p>
<p>I read online that I needed to heat the mead to 150F for 20
minutes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/The-Mead-From-Hell/FirstPasteurization.jpeg" alt="Cookin in the kitchen"></p>
<p>I got to get my first taste of the concoction tonight. And
wow, it&rsquo;s pretty good.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/The-Mead-From-Hell/FirstGlass.jpeg" alt="A treat"></p>
<p>I was thinking that it would be far too dry to be enjoyable
in this state, but the apples were so sweet that it was
very delicious and apple forward.</p>
